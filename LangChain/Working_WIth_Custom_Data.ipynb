      "Okay, so I need to figure out what the capital of France is. Hmm, I remember learning about capitals in school, but let me think carefully. I know that Paris is a major city there and it's often mentioned as a global capital because it's so influential culturally and economically. But wait, isn't there another city called Lyon? I've heard people talk about Lyon too, especially when visiting France. Maybe both are capitals?\n",
      "\n",
      "I should check if Paris is indeed the official capital. From what I recall, Paris has been the capital for a long time. I think it was established in the late 18th century during the French Revolution. That makes sense because after the revolution, many new institutions and governments were formed there. So, Paris would be the permanent seat of government.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then why do people sometimes mention Lyon? Maybe it's not as formal or official. I've heard that Lyon is a beautiful city with its own attractions like the Ch√¢teau de la Loire and the Rhone River. It's also known for food, like Lyonese cuisine. But does that make it a capital too?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think in official terms, only one city can be the capital of a country. So even though Lyon is significant, Paris is the designated capital. I should confirm this to be sure. Maybe looking up some sources or reliable information would help solidify my understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, another thought: sometimes countries have multiple capitals for different purposes, like economic hubs or educational centers. But in France's case, Paris seems to hold that singular position as both a political and cultural hub. So I'm pretty confident now that Paris is the capital.\n",

      "a compass.  One of the hardest parts of doing a startup is that you\n",
      "have so many choices.  There are just two or three of you, and a\n",
      "thousand things you could do. How do you decide?Here's the answer: Do whatever's best for your users.  You can hold\n",
      "onto this like a rope in a hurricane, and it will save you if\n",
      "anything can.  Follow it and it will take you through everything\n",
      "you need to do.It's even the answer to questions that seem unrelated, like how to\n",
      "convince investors to give you money.  If you're a good salesman,\n",
      "you could try to just talk them into it.  But the more reliable\n",
      "route is to convince them through your users: if you make something\n",
      "users love enough to tell their friends, you grow exponentially,\n",
      "and that will convince any investor.Being good is a particularly useful strategy for making decisions\n",
      "in complex situations because it's stateless.  It's like telling\n",
      "the truth.  The trouble with lying is that you have to remember\n",
      "everything you've said in the past to make sure you don't contradict\n",
      "yourself.  If you tell the truth you don't have to remember anything,\n",
      "and that's a really useful property in domains where things happen\n",
      "fast.For example, Y Combinator has now invested in 80 startups, 57 of\n",
      "which are still alive.  (The rest have died or merged or been\n",
      "acquired.)  When you're trying to advise 57 startups, it turns out\n",
      "you have to have a stateless algorithm.  You can't have ulterior\n",
      "motives when you have 57 things going on at once, because you can't\n",
      "remember them.  So our rule is just to do whatever's best for the\n",
      "founders.  Not because we're particularly benevolent, but because\n",
      "it's the only algorithm that works on that scale.When you write something telling people to be good, you seem to be\n",
      "claiming to be good yourself.  So I want to say explicitly that I\n",
      "am not a particularly good person.  When I was a kid I was firmly\n",
      "in the camp of bad.  The way adults used the word good, it seemed\n",
      "to be synonymous with quiet, so I grew up very suspicious of it.You know how there are some people whose names come up in conversation\n",
      "and everyone says \"He's such a great guy?\"  People never say\n",
      "that about me.  The best I get is \"he means well.\"  I am not claiming\n",
      "to be good.  At best I speak good as a second language.So I'm not suggesting you be good in the usual sanctimonious way.\n",
      "I'm suggesting it because it works.  It will work not just as a\n",
      "statement of \"values,\" but as a guide to strategy,\n",
      "and even a design spec for software.  Don't just not be evil.  Be\n",
      "good.Notes[1] Fifty years ago\n",
      "it would have seemed shocking for a public company not to pay\n",
      "dividends.  Now many tech companies don't.  The markets seem to\n",
      "have figured out how to value potential dividends.  Maybe that isn't\n",
      "the last step in this evolution.  Maybe markets will eventually get\n",
      "comfortable with potential earnings. (VCs already are, and at least\n",
      "some of them consistently make money.)I realize this sounds like the stuff one used to hear about the\n",
      "\"new economy\" during the Bubble.  Believe me, I was not drinking\n",
      "that kool-aid at the time.  But I'm convinced there were some \n",

      "ideas buried in Bubble thinking.  For example, it's ok to focus on\n",
      "growth instead of profits‚Äîbut only if the growth is genuine.\n",
      "You can't be buying users; that's a pyramid scheme.   But a company\n",
      "with rapid, genuine growth is valuable, and eventually markets learn\n",
      "how to value valuable things.[2] The idea of starting\n",
